# Decentralized Proof of Existence dApp

## Project Title
Decentralized Proof of Existence dApp

## Project Description
The Decentralized Proof of Existence dApp is designed to create immutable proof of existence records for digital documents or files on the Stellar blockchain. By leveraging smart contracts, users can submit cryptographic hashes of their documents to the blockchain, ensuring a verifiable record of their existence at a specific time. The dApp utilizes Lumens (XLM) for transaction fees, ensuring a cost-effective and transparent process.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to provide a decentralized and secure platform where individuals and organizations can prove the existence and integrity of their digital assets without relying on third-party intermediaries. The immutable nature of blockchain ensures that once a proof of existence record is created, it cannot be tampered with, providing trust and transparency in digital document management.

## Key Features
- **Proof of Existence**: Users can submit a cryptographic hash of their document to the blockchain, creating an unchangeable record.
- **Timestamping**: The smart contract records the exact timestamp when the document proof is submitted, ensuring precise time-based verification.
- **Verification**: Users can verify the existence of a document by comparing its hash with the stored record on the blockchain.
- **Stellar Blockchain Integration**: The dApp is built on the Stellar blockchain, utilizing its fast and cost-efficient transaction processing.
- **Transaction Fees in Lumens (XLM)**: All transactions are processed using Stellarâ€™s native cryptocurrency, Lumens (XLM), ensuring low-cost operations.
